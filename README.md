Models of compensatory and pursuit tracking

Extrapolation_model.py contains a script that runs a simulation of pursuit or compensatory tracking with two models: a position control model and a position extrapolation model

These models were compared in the publication:
Parker, M.G., Weightman, A.P., Tyson, S.F. et al. (2020). Sensorimotor delays in tracking may be compensated by negative feedback control of motion-extrapolated position.
